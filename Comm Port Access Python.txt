You can use the serial library in Python to monitor and detect unauthorized access to COM ports. Below is a simple example program that checks for changes in the list of available COM ports and alerts if any new port is detected:


import serial.tools.list_ports
import time
import ctypes

def get_available_ports():
    return [port.device for port in serial.tools.list_ports.comports()]

def alert(message):
    ctypes.windll.user32.MessageBoxW(0, message, "Unauthorized COM Port Access", 1)

def monitor_ports():
    previous_ports = get_available_ports()

    while True:
        current_ports = get_available_ports()

        if current_ports != previous_ports:
            new_ports = set(current_ports) - set(previous_ports)
            if new_ports:
                alert(f"Unauthorized access to COM port(s): {', '.join(new_ports)}")

        previous_ports = current_ports
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    monitor_ports()


This script uses the serial.tools.list_ports module to get a list of available COM ports. It then continuously monitors for changes in the list of ports. If any new ports are detected, it triggers an alert.

Note: This example is for Windows, and the alert uses the ctypes library for a simple pop-up message box. If you are using a different operating system or want a different way of alerting, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

Remember to run this script with appropriate permissions, especially if it's monitoring ports that require elevated privileges.
